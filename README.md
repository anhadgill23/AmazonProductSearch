# Amazon Product Search

This is a tool to find product information from Amazon, given an Amazon product indentification number. It scrapes the required data from the website to return product name, category, dimensions and rank.


# Testing

For this application, there's no point in testing the http library or database interactions. The respective maintenainers already do that. This leaves with testing the parsing logic.
